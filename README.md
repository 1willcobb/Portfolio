# Portfolio

Will Cobb's Developer Portfolio 

## My Task

I was tasked with completing a portfolio with the following criteria:

* Sample of previous work
* Present developers name, recent photo, links for About me, Work, and how to contact me.
* Links in nav to automatically scroll to sections of the portfolio site.
* Present my applications with the first being the largest in size.
* when you resize the page, it is responsive to viewport. 

## Inspiration

I wanted to go above and beyond on this to practice my skills. I found inspiration in the framework from Virgina Orosa. I have yet to impliment some of her animations but did apply a few of my own and took my own take on the project.

* flexboxed used often to be responsive
